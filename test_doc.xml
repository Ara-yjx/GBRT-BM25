FT  14 MAR 94 / Mexican political threat

Mr Manuel Camacho Sols, the Mexican government's peace envoy in the southern
state of Chiapas, has indicated he might run for national office if the
government did not approve democratic reforms under discussion for the
country and failed to comply with the recent peace accord for the rebels in
Chiapas.
He thereby resisted rising pressure from his colleagues in the governing
party to rule himself out of the presidential race.
The party's 65-year hold on power could be jeopardised if Mr Camacho, a
former mayor of Mexico City and an ex-foreign minister, were to realise his
veiled threat to run as an opposition candidate in the presidential election
in August.
'If there are no advances in democracy and if, instead of accord, there is
polarisation and if anyone wants to trample on my political rights as a
citizen, then after I have fulfilled my mission in Chiapas, I will take the
necessary political decision to bring democracy and unity to Mexico,' Mr
Camacho told reporters.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Support for S American free trade area

Brazil's proposal to create a South American free trade area has won the
backing of the country's three partners in Mercosur, the regional common
market planned to come into effect next year.
Brazil and its partners Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay agreed last week to
begin negotiating the proposal with other countries in the second half of
this year, after final arrangements for Mercosur are agreed.
Mr Jose Arthur Denot Medeiros, responsible for Mercosur at the Brazilian
foreign ministry, said the idea for the free trade area, first suggested
last year, is an extension of Mercosur and designed to increase trade in the
continent: 'This should be seen as a further trade liberalisation move to
make South America eventually ready for some kind of convergency with an
expanded North American Free Trade Agreement.'
The free trade area is expected to go into effect over ten years from 1995.
It will be defined to cover 'substantially all' goods, or at least 80 per
cent of trade. Unlike Mercosur, the area would aim to create a customs
union, although some countries may be invited to join Mercosur at a later
stage.
Mr Denot Medeiros said the proposal was not designed as a response or
competitor to Nafta. Brazil believes the two entities could be complementary
and that some countries could be members of both. Chile, expected to be the
next invited to join Nafta, would also be an important member of the South
American area, he said.
Brazil's idea has received so far only a lukewarm response from other South
American countries. Some were awaiting a formal decision on whether to
proceed from the four Mercosur countries.
There have also been occasionally confusing signals from Argentina on its
commitment to Mercosur, after disagreement with Brazil over the rate of
common external tariffs to be applied. Tariffs on about 85 per cent of goods
have already been agreed and the two countries have until June to agree
tariffs on the remainder.
